## Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

This README provides an overview of key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java, including abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, and interfaces.

#### Abstraction
Abstraction is a fundamental OOP concept that focuses on simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on their essential attributes and behaviors. In Java, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

An abstract class defines the structure of a class without providing a complete implementation. It can contain both abstract methods (methods without a body) and concrete methods. Subclasses inheriting from an abstract class must provide implementations for its abstract methods.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. It enables the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.

In Java, method overriding enables a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method defined in its superclass. Dynamic method dispatch allows the JVM to determine the appropriate method implementation to execute based on the actual object type at runtime.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation emphasizes the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behavior) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. Access to the data is restricted through methods, which control how data can be manipulated.

Access modifiers (public, private, protected) in Java help enforce encapsulation by specifying the visibility of class members. Private data members can only be accessed through public methods, enabling controlled data manipulation and ensuring data integrity.

### Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass/base class). It promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.

In Java, the extends keyword is used to declare inheritance relationships. Subclasses inherit fields and methods from the superclass, and they can override inherited methods to provide specialized behavior.

### Interface
An interface defines a contract specifying a set of methods that implementing classes must provide. It enables multiple classes to share a common interface while providing their own implementations.

In Java, an interface is declared using the interface keyword. Classes implement interfaces using the implements keyword, and they must provide implementations for all methods defined in the interface.

These Java OOP concepts provide a powerful foundation for creating modular, maintainable, and extensible code. Understanding and applying these concepts are essential for designing robust and efficient software systems.
